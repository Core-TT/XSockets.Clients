## XSockets.Clients

This repository contains all clients for XSockets.NET 4.* that is maintained by Team XSockets Sweden AB

Do note that you have to add the JsonProtocol in the XSockets server for .NET MicroFramework clients since they are not RFC6455 compatible.

We currently have clients for:

- .NET 3.5
- .NET 4.0+
- MonoTouch (iOS)
- MonoDroid (Android)
- .NET Microframework 4.2
- .NET Microframework 4.3
